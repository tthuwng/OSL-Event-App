There is a web app that goes along with this app that allows specified admins and leaders to post events. You can sign into the web app using the provided email. The app will work without needing to use the web app, but here is the link if you need to use them both: https://osl-events-app.firebaseapp.com/. The file attached is a QR code for one of the events that is currently on the app, and can be used to test the check-in function of the app.
